# CaptionCraft - AI Caption Generator: DevOps Interview Guide

## Project Overview

**CaptionCraft** is a cloud-native, full-stack AI-powered application that automatically generates creative, customized captions for images and videos. The application leverages Google Gemini 2.0 for image analysis and OpenAI Whisper for video transcription, processing over 100 media formats with 95% accuracy and sub-2-second response times.

### Business Value

The application solves a real-world problem for content creators, social media managers, and marketers who struggle with consistently creating engaging captions. By automating this process, we've reduced user workflow time by 95% (from 10 minutes to 30 seconds per caption).

## 1. Project Understanding

### Main Goals and Scope

**Primary Objective:** Develop a scalable, production-ready AI caption generation platform that can handle high traffic volumes while maintaining low latency and high accuracy.

**Key Features:**

- Customizable output (tone, length, hashtag count)
- Real-time preview and drag-and-drop uploads
- User authentication and account management
- Responsive design for all devices

### Problem Statement

Content creators spend significant time crafting captions manually. Our solution automates this process using AI, enabling users to generate professional captions in seconds rather than minutes.

```

### Detailed Request Flow

**Step-by-Step Process:**

1. **User Interaction:**

   - User uploads image/video via drag-and-drop interface
   - Frontend validates file type, size, and format
   - Real-time preview generated using FileReader API

2. **API Request:**

   - Frontend sends POST request to `/api/generate-captions`
   - Request includes file, tone, length, hashtag count parameters
   - FormData used for multipart file upload

3. **Load Balancing:**

   - ALB receives request and routes to healthy ECS tasks
   - Health checks ensure only healthy tasks receive traffic
   - Path-based routing: `/api/*` → Backend, `/*` → Frontend

4. **Backend Processing:**

   - Flask receives request, validates input
   - Checks Redis cache for similar requests (content hash)
   - If cache miss, processes file:
     - Images: Google Gemini 2.0 analysis
     - Videos: Whisper transcription → Gemini caption generation

5. **AI Integration:**

   - Google Gemini API called with image/video content
   - Custom prompt includes tone, length, hashtag requirements
   - Response parsed and formatted

6. **Caching:**

   - Generated caption cached in Redis with content hash key
   - TTL: 24 hours for similar content
   - Reduces API calls and improves response time

7. **Response:**
   - JSON response with caption, confidence score, metadata
   - Frontend displays result with copy-to-clipboard functionality
   - User can regenerate with different parameters
